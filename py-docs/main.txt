NAME
    main - The project aims for plagiarism detection using Locality Sensitive Hahsing(LSH)

DESCRIPTION
    Process:
        - Shingling :- Changing documents into set of tokens.Any substring of length 
        of k can be called a k-shingle.Here we generate a sparse incidence matrix.
        - Minhashing :- In the last step we got incidence matrix which is sparse so 
        here we target to reduce the size of matrix by producing signature for each
        document present in the incidence matrix
        - LSH :- Here we divide the signature matrix into horizontal bands and applying hash
        functions.We use a hash function  for hashing every band and while hashing a band,its 
        parts of each document are hashed into a set of buckets.So documents 
        with the same signature  in the band will land into the same buckets
