NAME
    lsh - Hashing similar documents to same buckets to know the similar documents.

FUNCTIONS
    band_hashing(band, hash_f, buckets_dictionary)
        Helper-method: performs hash on bands.Input is band and it hashes it
        and puts in buckets_list at its respective postition.
    
    find_similar_documents(doc_id, buckets_list, signature_matrix, r, hash_f=None)
        Finds the  similar documents
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        buckets_list: list of dictionary objects generated by generate_bucket_list
        hash_f: the same hash function used for generate_bucket_list (optional)
        
        Returns
        -------
        Returns a set containing similar documents to given document
    
    generate_bucket_list(signature_matrix, r, hash_f=None)
        This function generates and returns the list of dictionaries where 
        each band is hashed to a bucket in a dictionary.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        signature_matrix: signatures of all the documents generated from minhashing (DataFrame)
        r: number of rows in each band (int)
        hash_f: hash function for hashing documents into buckets (optional)
        
        Returns
        -------
        buckets_list: Each dictionary contains hashes of column vectors of the
        band as keys and the list of documents as values.
    
    query_band_hashing(band, hash_f)
        helper-function: To Perform hash on query doc bands
